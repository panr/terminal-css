[Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme turned out to be an unexpected success. But not everyone wanted to switch to Hugo to be able to use it.

That's why I created **Terminal.css**. A stupid simple, custom set of semantic styles derived from the theme, that you always wanted.
