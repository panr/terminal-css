[Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme turned out to be an unexpected success. But not everyone wanted to switch to Hugo to be able to use it.

That's why I created **Terminal.css**. A stupid simple, custom set of semantic styles derived from the theme, that you always wanted.

## Presets

Terminal.css comes with a collection of [presets](./presets.json). I've kickstarted the project with only a few of them, but that's not enough. If you want to contribute to the project and already have an idea for a beautiful set of colors, you are in the right place.

1. Go to the [Terminal.css website](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/) and set your color scheme
2. Copy it as JSON
3. [Add it](./presets.json) to the collection via Pull Request
